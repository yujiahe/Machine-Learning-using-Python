The notebooks under this repo record my practice and exploratory in the machine learning area. It includes the following four files:

1. Data_Visualization_with_Python: I explored and visualized data to solve two problems.

2. Supervised Machine Learning with Python_Loan Prediction Project: I built four supervised machine learning models to
make predictions on whether a loan will be paid off or not. I compared the accuracy of the four models and found the best algorithm
in this case.

3. Unsupervised Machine Learning_Cluster Analysis_Tokyo Project: I conducted cluster analysis, an unsupervised machine learning method,
to explore and segment the neighborhoods in Tokyo into 10 clusters based on the features of venues in those neighborhoods.

4. Unsupervised Machine Learning_Cluster Analysis_Toronto Project: This can be considered as a practice/test prior to the Tokyo project.
